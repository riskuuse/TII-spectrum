QVT for sound and camera:

When booted, run `cat /proc/asound/cards` and find the number of your sound device there.

Check if there is a correct configuration in /etc/asound.conf file:
```
...
slave {
    pcm "hw:3,0" <- Set here ID of device,as in cat /proc/asound/cards
...
ctl.dmixer {
        type hw
        card 3 <- Set here ID of device,as in cat /proc/asound/cards
}
```
To test sound, run
`speaker-test -c2`
You should hear a (white?) noise.

The easiest way to test camera is to visit https://webcamtests.com/ service.
Remember to configure networking and set correct time in prior.
